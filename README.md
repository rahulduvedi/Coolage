For description of the script please open the file above and my comments will also guide you
Guys, you need to install some python modules using pip just open your command prompt(run as administrator) to using following commands
1. For NumPy - pip install NumPy
2. for OpenCV- pip install OpenCV-python
3.for tesseract - pip install tesseract
4. After this, you need to install a software (tesseract)
The link to that is :-https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev.exe
install the software, please remember where it is getting saved in your PC
by default it is program files, then you need to change the path in my code(it is showing the path of tesseract.exe of my laptop) set the path to your tesseract.exe
Then you are good to go
